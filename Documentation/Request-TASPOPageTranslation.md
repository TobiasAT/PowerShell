# Request-TASPOPageTranslation

## SYNOPSIS
This PowerShell script is designed to automate the translation of SharePoint Online pages using the DeepL API.  
For details and additional notes read my blog post at https://blog-en.topedia.com/?p=37491.

## DESCRIPTION
The script begins by checking if a connection to SharePoint Online has been established using the Connect-PnPOnline cmdlet. If not, it throws an error and exits.  
It then retrieves a secret from Azure Key Vault, which is used as the authorization key for the DeepL API.

The script identifies the SharePoint Online Site Pages library and retrieves the main language of the SharePoint site. It also constructs the URL of the page to be translated.
Depending on the edition of DeepL being used (Free or Pro), it sets the appropriate API URL.

The script then checks if the page is already in the target language. If it is, it skips the translation. If not, it creates a new page in the target language if one doesn't already exist.
The script then retrieves the source and target pages and constructs the request bodies for the DeepL API calls to translate the title, description, and content of the page.

The translated text is then used to update the target page. If the PublishPage variable is set to true, the script publishes the page.

Finally, the script outputs the URL of the translated page.
